    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learned by reading the instructions on screen and correcting my mistakes when the program says it is wrong. If I still got it wrong I would ask a friend who has already done that bit.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I did lots and got two and a half lessons done in the time. I worked hard and productively. I did a lot more than previous lessons.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will try and start the python course straight away and maybe I will finish it. I can improve my learning by asking the teacher for help if google or codecademy can't help. And I can also get more work done than last week.</td>
