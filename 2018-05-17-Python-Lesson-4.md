  <tr>
    <td>I learned by reading the instructions on screen and correcting my mistakes when the program says it is wrong. If I still got it wrong I would ask a friend who has already done that bit and a lot more. I also  am improving my blog by adding containers to my blog posts and correcting the order they are in.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I did lots and got about three lessons (within the big python lesson) done in the time. I worked hard and productively. I also found out by blog was not good enough.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will try and start the python course straight away and maybe I will finish it. I can improve my learning by asking the teacher for help if google or codecademy can't help. And I can also get more work done than last week. Also I hope my teacher doesnâ€™t take too long when he checks my blog again so I can get more codecademy work in.</td>
