    <td>I learned by reading the instructions on screen and correcting my mistakes when the program says it is wrong. If I still got it wrong I would ask a friend who has already done that bit and a lot more. I also  am improving my blog by adding containers to my blog posts and correcting the order they are in.

    <td>I did lots and got about two lessons (within the big python lesson) done in the time. I tried to work hard but my teacher kept telling me to get a lot of yellow cards (30 minute lunch time detention) for the people who have not sorted their blog out. If my blog is bad I will get a yellow card either though I can do nothing. If I publish my blog documents in the right order it will still come out in the same order as now which is messed up and in  the wrong order. My background colour is not working and these are just some of the things I can not control even though I should be able to.

  <tr>
    <td>I will try and start the python course straight away and maybe I will finish it. I can improve my learning by asking the teacher for help if google or codecademy can't help. And I can also get more work done than last week. Also I hope my teacher doesnâ€™t take too long when he checks my blog again so I can get more codecademy work in. Also I hope my teacher understands that my blog is broken and I can not fix it.</td>
